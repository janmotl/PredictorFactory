PostgreSQL pgjdbc-ng Driver
------------------------
Version:    0.6
Files:      pgjdbc-ng-0.6.jar
Reference:  https://github.com/impossibl/pgjdbc-ng
Note:       As of version 0.3 (February, 2014), it claims to be JDBC 4.1 feature complete.
            That is good because the official 9.4 PostgreSQL driver is not JDBC 4.1 feature complete.
            Also, this driver is able to detect and report unclosed resources.
            However, this driver can consume over 250MB of memmory and is by 10% slower than
            the official version of the driver.
