	<name>Time of peak</name>
	<description>
		Time, when a numerical attribute reaches its minimum/maximum. In case of a tie the most recent value is returned.
		
		Note: NumericalColumn can be null and that can cause ties -> avoid nulls. However, ties can still happen ->
		pick the most recent (the maximum) time value (note that it also deals with ties at temporalColumn level).

		NOTE: Could depend on the temporal constraint rather than on a time column.

	<example>
		When did the customer transfer the biggest amount.
