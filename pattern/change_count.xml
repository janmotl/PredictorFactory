	<name>Change count</name>
	<description>
		Count of changes of an attribute value in time.
		
		Note: This pattern is different from the count of duplicates - you can have a list of binary values, but still
		have more than two changes.

		NOTE: Transitions from/to NULL are ignored in the sum (because A!=B returns NULL, if at least one value is NULL).
		This may not be a desirable behaviour. A solution of the problem could be to use following equality test:
			(A = B) OR (ISNULL(A, B) IS NULL)

		NOTE: The ordering by @temporalColumn may not be unique - for example, if @temporalColumn is a date attribute and
		multiple events happen during a day. Consequently, it may always return slightly different result.

		NOTE: Pattern nominal_change was a duplicate -> removed nominal_change.

		Note: Does not work on MySQL.
