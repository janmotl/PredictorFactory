	<description>Sample skewness.

		To get at least somehow reliable estimation of skewness and kurtosis requires at least 10 samples. To get a
		usable estimate, you need hundreds of samples. Reference:
			https://www.spcforexcel.com/knowledge/basic-statistics/are-skewness-and-kurtosis-useful-statistics

		NOTE: We return an estimate, only if the standard deviation exists (requires at least 2 samples) and is non-zero.
		This behaviour is consistent with the behaviour of skewness command in MATLAB.
		NOTE: Kurtosis will be added once support for multiple columns in the result will be implemented.

		The implementation is from: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Database/MS_Access/A_2529-Median-Mode-Skewness-and-Kurtosis-in-MS-Access.html

		Note: Clipping of the data could be detected with a ratio of extreme values (a range close to min/max)
		to the count of values in another pattern.

	<example>
		Skewness can be a sign of data truncation. For example, balance withdrawn from an ATM can be skewed
		because of too low limit on the credit card.
