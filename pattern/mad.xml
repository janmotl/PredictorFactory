	<name>Mean absolute difference</name>
	<description>
		Mean absolute difference measure dispersion (MAD), just like variance. The only difference is,
		that variance squares the differences, while MAD takes absolute values of differences.
		Hence, MAD is less influenced by outliers than variance.

		Do not confuse with median absolute deviation (also MAD).

		Note that we do not perform sample correction (correction of the degree of freedom) but instead return
		population based estimate.
