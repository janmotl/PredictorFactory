	<description>
		Value of the numerical field divided by a statistic (MEAN, PERCENTILE) of the nominal field. 
		Useful to be used in composition with pattern parent field or parent from hierarchical lookup.
		
		select Key
		  , Ratio(Field, Y)
		from Table t
		  left join (select Segmentor, Y = Statistic(Field)
		      from Table
		      where Filter
		      group by Segmentor) s 
		    on t.Segmentor=s.Segmentor	
		    
		Warning: Data leakage happens as all @baseId are used to calculate the average while only training
		samples should be used. If you have a lot of samples, balanced classes and no outliers the practical 
		effect of data leakage should be minimal. But beware of extreme scenarios!

		This pattern is producing great predictors with reasonable speed.
