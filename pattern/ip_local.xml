<pattern>
	<name>IP local</name>
	<description>
		If it is a local IP address, return 1 else 0.

		Note: This pattern only looks at the beginning of the string. So, even "127.nonsense" will be treated as a
		local IP. To make it worse, we do not respect range: 172.16.0.0 â€“ 172.31.255.255 tightly enough.

		Note: Some databases, like PostgreSQL, use a specialized data type for IPs.

		Note: This is a specialized version of "prefix" pattern.

	<example>
		Logged traffic from local addresses is likely only for testing purposes. Based on this pattern, we may separate
		real traffic from dummies.
