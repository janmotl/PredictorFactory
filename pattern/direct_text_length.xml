	<name>Direct text length</name>
	<description>Returns the length (character count) of a character variable.

	<example>
		Sometimes the cardinality of the nominal column is too high to
		process the column with existential quantifier. And the length of the string can bear some information. For
		example, passengers with a long name were more likely to survive sinking of Titanic than passengers with
		short name because passengers with many names and titles were more likely to travel in higher class and
		as such had better access to the life boats.
