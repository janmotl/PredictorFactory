	<name>Change ratio</name>
	<description>
		Ratio of increases to decreases in time. If the attribute is nominal, we look at the alphabetical order of the
		values.
		
		Note: The value is regularized toward 1. When no change happens, 1 is returned. Also by using regularization
		we avoid division by zero.

		Note: Does not work on MySQL.

	<example>
		Detect, whether the person is a seller (many small incomes, a few big expenses) or an employee (many small expenses, a few incomes).
