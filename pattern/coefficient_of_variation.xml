	<name>Coefficient of variation</name>
	<description>
		This is a special scenario of ratio of aggregates. 
	</description>
	<example>
		Transaction amount
		
		Transaction balance - customers with high coefficient of variation are less likely to pay off the loan in time
		(they often have negative balance -> average balance is around zero -> coefficient of variation is high).
