	<name>Direct field</name>
	<description>
		Returns ALL columns from the table. The advantage of "Direct field" in comparison to "Aggregate max" is 
		that it also returns non-numerical columns.

		This pattern is commonly producing the best predictors.
		
		Note: Direct field also returns the target column! This is desirable as in time series analysis you may not
		have anything but the past values of the target. But if lead==0 then the "current" target will leak into the 
		predictors.
		
		Note: Time variables are handled here with a fixed reference. For floating reference pattern time_since_direct
		is used. Neither of the approaches completely dominates the other. Hence both approaches are tested. But only
		one for the given attribute should be chosen (as they are highly correlated).
