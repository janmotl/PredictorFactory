		From the child entity with filter F select one record 
		with predefined rank order K according to some sort ordering S 
		and from that record take a predefined field X.
		
		Original MSSQL implementation using row_number
		
		select Relation.ParentKey
		  , t.Field
		from (select Relation.ParentKey
		  , c.Field
		  , K = row_number() over (
		    partition by Relation.ParentKey
		    order by SortExpression)
		from Relation.Parent p
		  left join Relation.Child c 
		    on Relation.JoinCondition and Filter) t
		where t.K = Rank
		
		is not feasible in mySQL, so I am trying the trick by Mosty Mostacho
