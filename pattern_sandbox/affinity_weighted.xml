	<description>
		Similar to WoE, but without normalization and transformation with logarithm. For decision trees it should be
		as informative as WoE, but the calculation should be faster. For interpretability or logistic regression, WoE
		is still preferred.
		
		Note: 
		  - Dependent on target (nominal/numerical).
		  - The inner table should be calculated just once per table.
		  - Multiple columns could be returned.		
		  - Weighting: weight=(count(*))^0.5; score=sum(t2.b*t2.weight)/sum(t2.a*t2.weight); doesn't improve Chi2 
		  
		NOTE: CURRENTLY WORKS ONLY FOR NOMINAL TARGETS (VALUES ARE IN SINGLE QUOTES).
		  
		Warning:
			This pattern is using target values in the calculation. Be careful with splitting of the data into
			training and testing part.
