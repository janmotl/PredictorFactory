		Probability estimate with leave-one-out estimate (the label from the current row is ignored).

		The estimate is adjusted with Laplace correction. The implemented Laplace correction assumes binary label.

		Tests:
			1) For id attributes the computed Chi2 is 0
			2) Works with nulls in the attribute (you may test it on financial.district.A15 - currently it fails in EM, just exclude nulls and leave this on isNull pattern)
			3) Works with nulls in the label
