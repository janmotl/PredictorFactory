	<name>Concentration</name>
	<description>Any statistic (e.g. percentage of the most frequent value) calculated from the distribution 
	of the nominal child field with child filter F.
	
	NOTE: IT COULD WORK ON IDS.

	</description>
	<example>
	Concentration ratio of the credit bureau enquiries. 
	In this case the child entity is enquiry and segmentor is credit grantor making the enquiry. 
	Low values of concentration ratio indicate many credit grantors making enquiries and high credit risk.
	
	A customer with high variety of transactions (withdrawal, transfer order, credit card...) is more
	likely to pay the loan in time.
