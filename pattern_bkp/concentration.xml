	<name>Concentration</name>
	<description>
		Any statistic (e.g. percentage of the most frequent value) calculated from the distribution
		of the nominal child field with child filter F.

		Note: This pattern is similar to entropy. The difference is that this pattern only looks at the distribution of
		the most common value, while entropy looks at the distribution of all occurring values.

		Note: Does not work on MySQL (calculation of mode).
	</description>
	<example>
		Concentration ratio of the credit bureau enquiries.
		In this case the child entity is enquiry and segmentor is credit grantor making the enquiry.
		Low values of concentration ratio indicate many credit grantors making enquiries and high credit risk.

		A customer with high variety of transactions (withdrawal, transfer order, credit card...) is more
		likely to pay the loan in time.
