	<name>Aggregate range</name>
	<description>
		As many databases do not support range aggregate, calculate it with min and max. The value is given with:
		f(x) = max(x) - min(x),
		where x is an attribute.

	<example>
		Swing on the account (the difference between the highest and lowest balance during the period).
