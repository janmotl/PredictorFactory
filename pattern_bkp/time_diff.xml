	<name>Time diff</name>
	<description>
		Difference between two times.

		Note: This pattern produces a lot of duplicate features because PF currently assumes that all multivariate
		patterns are not symmetrical. Hence, PF calculates diff(A,B) and diff(B,A). But from the point of modeling,
		these two patterns contain the same information.
