		Real-world data commonly contain contain missing values. And sometimes they are not missing at random. 
		Thus we mine them.

		Inspired by: Cohen and Cohen (1975) have suggested developing
		missing data dummy codes for each variable with missing data, and using this
		missing variable code as a predictor in a regression model.

		This pattern has a good predictive power/runtime ratio. However, this pattern also frequently produces duplicate
		predictors because occurrence of nulls is positively correlated between columns in a single table.

	<example>
		In Titanic dataset passengers with missing age are more likely to die. This is because information about 
		the customers' age was obtained after Titanic's sinking. And it was easier to obtain this information from 
		the survivals than from the victims.
