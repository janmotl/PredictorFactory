	<name>Time from peak</name>
	<description>
		Elapsed time in seconds from the moment, when a numerical attribute reached its maximum/minimum value.
		In the case of a tie, time from the most recent maximum/minimum is returned.
		
		Note: NumericalColumn can be null and that can cause ties -> avoid nulls. However, ties can still happen ->
		pick the most recent (the maximum) time value (note that it also deals with ties at temporalColumn level).

		Note: It is known to fail on PostgreSQL with timetz ant timestamp target_date (they are not additive).

		Note: Does not work on MySQL.
