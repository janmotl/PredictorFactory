	<name>Time from peak</name>
	<description>
		Elapsed time from the moment, when a numerical attribute reached its maximum/minimum value. In the case of
		a tie, time from the most recent maximum/minimum is returned.
		
		Note: NumericalColumn can be null and that can cause ties -> avoid nulls. However, ties can still happen ->
		pick the most recent (the maximum) time value (note that it also deals with ties at timeColumn level).

	<example>
		How long ago did the customer transfer the biggest amount.
