	<name>Segment comparison</name>
	<description>
		Value of the numerical field divided by a statistic (MEAN, PERCENTILE) of the nominal field. 
		Useful to be used in composition with pattern parent field or parent from hierarchical lookup.
		
		select Key
		     , Ratio(Field, Y)
		from Table t
		left join (
			select Segmentor, Y = Statistic(Field)
			from Table
			where Filter
			group by Segmentor) s
		on t.Segmentor=s.Segmentor

		This pattern is producing great predictors with reasonable speed.
	</description>
	<note>
		Note: If the @numericalColumn is an integer, it may happen that @numericalColumn=@nominalColumn (as
		predictor factory treats integers once as numerical and once as nominal).
		In that case the pattern intentionally fails.

		Note: We have to be careful about data leakage. While averages can be calculated based on all the data,
		only training samples should be used. We partially deal with this issue by using LOO. Now, if the nominal
		attribute is an ID, the predictors will at least have zero Chi2.

		Note: To avoid integer division and subsequent possibility of division by zero, we cast the nominator to float.

		Note: This pattern is similar to WoE. The difference is that we do not compare a nominal attribute to label, but
		a numerical attribute to some nominal attribute.
