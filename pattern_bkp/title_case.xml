	<name>Title Case</name>
	<description>
		Is the string in "Title Case" format? In other words, are all initial letters in upper case and everything else
		in lower case?
	</description>
	<example>
		Commonly names of peoples and addresses follow title case format (at least in countries of Greek-Latin heritage).
		Consequently, if a customer enters a name that does not follow this rule, the probability that it is a fake 
		name increases.
