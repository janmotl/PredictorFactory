	<name>Time since direct</name>
	<description>Time since some date in the past till the time when the prediction is required (defined with @baseDate). 
	
	Because we are guaranteed that there is just one date per the group (cardinality is set to 1), it is wasteful to try
	several aggregates as in "Time since" pattern.
	
	Note: Cardinality of n is handled in time_since.

	<example>
	Example usage: Consider a column with birth year. Then age is more appropriate as a modeling variable because it is 
	not time dependent. A model will predict the behavior of 20-year-old people today, next year, and five years from 
	now, and will always be predicting the behavior of incoming 20-year-old people based on the experience data.
