	<description>Mode

		This pattern is producing great predictors.

		NOTE: Works also on id!
	
		Note: The implementation for PostgreSQL is supported from PostgreSQL 9.4.
	
		NOTE: THE VERSION FOR SAS CAN RETURN TOO MANY ROWS BECAUSE OF TIES.

		This pattern is fast and produces good predictors.

	<example>
		The typical payment amount.
		Example when mode fails: mode of ISBN is not meaningful because people commonly the same book just once. Hence "the most common" value doesn't exist.
