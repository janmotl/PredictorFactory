	<name>Mode</name>
	<description>
		The most frequent value.

		Example when mode fails: mode of ISBN is not meaningful because people commonly buy the same book just once.
		Hence "the most common" value doesn't exist.

		This pattern is fast and produces great predictors.

	<note>
		Note: The implementation for PostgreSQL is supported from PostgreSQL 9.4.

		Note: Does not work on MySQL.
	
		NOTE: THE VERSION FOR SAS CAN RETURN TOO MANY ROWS BECAUSE OF TIES.

	<example>
		The typical payment amount.
