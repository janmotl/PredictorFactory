	<description>
		Relative frequency of the given nominal value in the population.

		Based on Learning Feature Engineering for Classification from Nargesian, this pattern should incur performance
		improvement for the majority of attributes. Similar observation is described in: CatBoost: gradient boosting
		with categorical features support from Dorogush.

		Frequency of the client's name - which tells us, whether the client is a foreigner, or not. And based 
		on that we can offer him/her different products.
