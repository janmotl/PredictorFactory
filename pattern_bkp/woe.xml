	<description>Weight of evidence.

		In comparison to the textbook formulation this implementation takes care of:
			1) Missing values (they are treated as a separate category)
			2) Zero probabilities (with Laplace correction)
			3) Polynomial target
			4) Leaking target values (by using leave one out trick - it is fast as we just subtract the current target value from the global results)

		Note that WoE still ignores confidence of the estimates. For example, if we have 2 positive samples and
		5 negative samples, we get the same WoE as if we had 2000 positive samples and 5000 negative samples.
		Intuitively, the second scenario should result into a value further from zero. Nevertheless, this problem is
		partially solved with leave-one-out: with small sample size, the variance of the estimate is higher.

		The implementation is from: https://qizeresearch.wordpress.com/2014/05/21/utilize-woe-to-replace-dummy-variables/

		To avoid division by zero and logarithm of zero in evaluation of WoE we use the Laplace correction.
		Laplacean correction is from: http://shigglesblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/weight-of-evidence.html

		The empirical evidence suggests that Laplacean correction improves AUC by 5 percent points.

		Target value is always treated as a string because databases automatically cast numbers to strings, if necessary.
		But databases do not automatically cast strings to numbers. Hence, treating the target value as a string works
		for both, numerical and string targets.

		NOTE: We do not calculate WoE for NULL category in the attribute.
		For examples of the implementation see http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings13/095-2013.pdf
		or https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Causata/Causata.pdf
		Missing values should be treated as a special category as explained at: http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/08/13/weight-of-evidence/

		NOTE: We do not calculate WoE for NULL target value as it just unnecessarily increases the count
		of rows in the predictor.

		Multi-class WoE: http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/11641/c4.pdf

		NOTE: Training and testing data are getting mixed -> expect overly optimistic estimates.

		NOTE: WORKS ONLY ON BINARY TARGETS! -> produce a column for each target class

		NOTE: Oracle may require specifying logarithm base.

		Some other predictors are mentioned in ACORA (Provost).
