	<name>Aggregate distinct</name>
	<description>
		Applies aggregation function on distinct values.
	</description>
	<note>
		Note that distinct count is implemented in "num_child_types" because it can be executed on any data type.

		Note that stddev_samp distinct doesn't work in MariaDB.

		Note that to get standard deviation working with distinct in Oracle, we have to use "stddev" command.

		Note: On big tables an approximate formulation like hyperloglog can be desirable:

	</note>
	<example>
		Sum of unique (impact scored) warnings. In the case of a faulty sensor that floods the log with the same error this pattern can be better than plain aggregate. Nevertheless, the odds are ~50:50 that aggregate_distinct is better than aggregate (in the rest of situations it is just reversed).
