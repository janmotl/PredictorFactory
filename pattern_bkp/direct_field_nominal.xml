	<name>Direct field nominal</name>
	<description>
		Takes an integer and prefixes it with underscore in order to convert it into varchar. The point of this
		transformation is that Chi2 will be calculated as if the attribute was nominal (id attributes can be, indeed,
		treated as nominal) AND the modelling tool will import it as nominal (without user's interaction).
	</description>
	<note>
		Note: Direct field also returns the target column! This is desirable as in time series analysis you may not
		have anything but the past values of the target. But if lead==0 then the "current" target will leak into the
		predictors.

		Note: Bigint is intentionally omitted as its cardinality is likely too large to be of any use.

		Indicated “likely to donate” on 2009 alumni survey.
