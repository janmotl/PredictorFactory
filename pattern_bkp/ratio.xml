	<name>Ratio</name>
	<description>Ratio of the two fields X and Y.
	
		Ratio(NULL, Y) = NULL
		Ratio(X, NULL) = NULL
		Ratio(X, 0) = NULL
		Ratio(0, Y) = 0
		Ratio(X, Y) = 100*X/Y

		Note: The implementation prefers to return NULL when the ratio is ill defined.
		If you want to 0 instead of NULL, just add coalesce.

		This pattern is slow, but produces great predictors.
	
		NOTE: COULD HAVE BEEN EXTENDED INTO RATIOS OF AGGREGATES
