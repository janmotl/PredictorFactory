		Entropy estimate for numerical attributes.

		The calculation is based on page 13 of:
			http://www.slideshare.net/DataRobot/featurizing-log-data-before-xgboost
	</description>
	<note>
		Note: To avoid integer division, we cast "count" and "sum" to float.

		Note: Avoid decimals, because a logarithm of a decimal variable is ~100 slower than the logarithm of a float.
		The results obtained with floats are equal to results on decimal for ~13 decimal digits.

		Note: We may get error that we cannot take a logarithm of zero/negative number.
