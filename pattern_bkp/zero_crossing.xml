	<name>Zero crossing</name>
	<description>
		Count of how many times zero was crossed.
		
		Note: In the edge conditions such as 4 consecutive points {-1,0,0,1} we have to make a decision, whether
		to consider this scenario as 1 or 2 zero crossings. With the presented implementation, 2 crossings would
		be counted. 
		
		Note: Sometimes we may want to count only transitions from negative to positive numbers (or reversely).
		However, in this implementation both directions are counted.
		
		Note: The inequality signs "less than" and "greater than" have to be escaped in XML.

	<example>
		People whose balance on the account frequently gets into negative value are less likely to payoff their loan.
