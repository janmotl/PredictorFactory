	<name>Coefficient of variation</name>
	<description>
		This is a special scenario of ratio of aggregates. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation
		to the mean.

		The advantage of Coefficient of variation (CV) is that the actual value of the CV is independent of the unit
		in which the measurement has been taken, so it is a dimensionless number. For comparison between data sets with
		different units or widely different means, one should use the coefficient of variation instead of the standard
		deviation.

		The disadvantage is that CV does not make sense on attributes that may take both, positive and negative values.

	<example>
		Transaction balance - customers with high coefficient of variation are less likely to pay off the loan in time
		(they often have negative balance -> average balance is around zero -> coefficient of variation is high).
