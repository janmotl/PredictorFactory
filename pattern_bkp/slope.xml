	<name>Slope</name>
	<description>
		Slope of an attribute in time as estimated with a linear regression.

		In comparison to correlation, this pattern looks at the angle of the fitted line, while correlation looks at
		how well the data can be fit by the line multiplied by the sign of the direction of the line.
	</description>
	<note>
		NOTE: Could calculate slope of two numerical attributes (in another pattern).
		NOTE: Whenever correlation is calculated manually, arithmetic overflow can happen.
		NOTE: DateToNumber function is automatically replaced with the database aware function call.
		NOTE: Since we use DateToNumber, it works on all temporal types (at least in PostgreSQL).

	<example>
		Trend of customer's balance on his account.
