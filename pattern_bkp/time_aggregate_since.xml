	<name>Time aggregate since</name>
	<description>
		Time since some date in the past till the time when the prediction is required (defined with @baseDate).
		The selection of the date is driven with aggregate functions like min, max and avg.

		In comparison to "time aggregate since event" we look at the timestamps of all the events, not just of some events.
		In comparison to "time since" we look at attributes in 1:n relationship to the target.
	</description>
	<example>
		Time from the last event.
