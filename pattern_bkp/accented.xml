	<description>
		Does the string contain a common accented character?

		Note: In MySQL we would have to use nested replace().
	</description>
	<example>
		In some countries, Latin alphabet is enriched by accents. But it takes time to write these accents.
		Consequently, informal text is written without accents. While formal text is still written with accents.
		Thus, this feature can asses the formality of the entered text.
