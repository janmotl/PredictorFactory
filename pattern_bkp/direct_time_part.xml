		The hour/day/month of the event.

		Note: The default solution should use JDBC scalar functions:
			http://documentation.progress.com/output/DataDirect/jdbcoschelp/index.html#page/jdbcosc/scalar-functions.html#

		Note: Some parts of the date/datetime may not be supported by the database or the keywords can be different.
		For example, day-of-week on PostgreSQL is "dow", but on MSSQL it's "weekday". 
		
		Note: It's not meaningful to attempt to extract hour from date column - it's reasonable to extract hour
		only from datetime.
		
		Note: It's not truly useful to extract a year for predictions in the future, because years do not repeat
		(if we omit tricks like considering years before Christ equal to years after Christ). Nevertheless, if we
		are doing explanatory analysis, or if we want to predict outcomes that are not outside of the range of 
		training data, year is a valid predictor.
