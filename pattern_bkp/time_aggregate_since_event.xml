	<name>Time aggregate since event</name>
	<description>Time since event E till the time when the prediction is required (defined with @baseDate).
		If multiple events E are present, return the time from the most recent event.
		If no event E exists, return null.

		In comparison to "time since", this works on sets.
		In comparison to "time aggregate since" we also add a filter.
	</description>
	<example>
		Time since the last mortgage contract.
