	<name>Odds ratio</name>
	<description>
		The pattern is from: Feature selection for unbalanced class distribution and Naive Bayes, Mladenic &amp; Grobelnik.
		Based on the empirical comparison in the article, odds ratio should be better than WoE. However, our empirical
		comparisons do not agree with the claim.

		In comparison to WoE, this pattern also takes into account conditional probailities of NOT observing the
		given attribute value.

		NOTE: This pattern is twice as fast as WoE.

		NOTE: To avoid division by zero we use pseudocounts (Laplace correction).

		NOTE: The equation as written was checked against the article with maple and is ok. Jan Motl, 29.9.2016.

		NOTE: TARGET VALUES SHOULD BE ESCAPED IN PF - if target is numerical, do not escape, if nominal, escape with
		the right escape character.

		Logarithmic odds that a customer is a female based on the client's address.
