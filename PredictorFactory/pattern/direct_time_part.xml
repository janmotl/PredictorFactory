	<description>
		The hour/day/month of the event.
		
		Note: Some parts of the date/datetime may not be supported by the database or the keywords can be different.
		For example, day-of-week on PostgreSQL is "dow", but on MSSQL it's "weekday". 
		
		Note: It's not meaningful to attempt to extract hour from date column - it's reasonable to extract hour
		only from datetime.

	<example>
		Time of waking up.
