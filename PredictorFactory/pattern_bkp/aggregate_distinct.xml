	<name>Aggregate distinct</name>
	<description>
		Apply aggregation function on distinct values.	
		
		Note that distinct count is implemented in "num_child_types" because it can be executed on any data type.
		
		Note that stddev_samp distinct doesn't work in MariaDB.
		
		Note that to get standard deviation working with distinct in Oracle, we have to use "stddev" command.
