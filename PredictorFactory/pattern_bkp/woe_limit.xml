	<name>WOE limit</name>
	<description>Weight of evidence.
	
	Considers only cases with at least 10 samples.
	
	The implementation is from: https://qizeresearch.wordpress.com/2014/05/21/utilize-woe-to-replace-dummy-variables/
	
	NOTE: Training and testing data are getting mixed -> expect overly optimistic estimates.
	
	NOTE: WORKS ONLY ON BINARY TARGETS! -> produce a column for each target class
	
	NOTE: ALSO WORKS ON CARDINALITY 1!
	
	NOTE: Interestingly enough, average of woe works better than sum of woe.
	
	NOTE: Laplace correction is applied to deal with division by zero and log of zeo. Note that non-standard value of
	0.5 (instead of 1) is used because it worked better on ftp dataset. Also note that I am not performing normalisation
	based on the count of unique values in @nominalValue multiplied by the count of classes.
	
	Could theoretically update woe estimates based on already estimated samples from testing set (iterative learning).  
	
	Some other predictors are mentioned in ACORA (Provost).
