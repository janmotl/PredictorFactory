	<name>Existential count</name>
	<description>
		Count of occurrences of a specific value.
		
		Null values are ignored as they are covered in null_ratio.
		
		NOTE: THE SINGLE QUOTES ARE GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS -> ESCAPE IN PF.

		Note: We could ignore values that appear in less than 5% of samples. Currently we use top 20 frequent values.
		The difference is evident if non-uniform distribution of the values is assumed.
		
		Literature reference: This pattern is similar to TF as used in Wordification. See:
			http://www.ipcsit.com/vol47/009-ICCTS2012-T049.pdf
		The difference is that we do not perform multiplication of TF with IDF to get TF-IDF, because
		IDF is constant for the predictor. In other words TF-IDF (as defined and used in Wordification) mostly just
		adds processing time (at least for decision trees and regression; however, for k-nn or distance based clustering
		TF-IDF variant is preferred). The only significant difference is if the value appears in all the base_ids -
		then the IDF part is zero and TF-IDF is constant, while TF itself doesn't have to be necessarily constant.

		Another literature reference: This pattern is similar to existential quantifier, which is commonly used in ILP.
		The difference is that the quantifier is binary, while count belongs to natural numbers. From the point of
		prediction accuracy the difference seems to be insignificant. See:
			http://www.ipcsit.com/vol47/009-ICCTS2012-T049.pdf

	<example>
		Whenever the dataset contains nominal attributes, the existential quantifier belongs to the most important
		patterns. An example of datasets where existential count excels: train dataset.
