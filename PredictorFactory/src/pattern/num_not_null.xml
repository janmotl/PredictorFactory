	<name>Number of non-missing values</name>
	<description>
		Real-world data commonly contain contain missing values. And sometimes they are not missing at random. 
		Thus we mine them. 
		 
		Technical note: NULL values are not commonly accounted in count() function. Hence we exploit it. An alternative
		is to use "case then" but that is slower. We could also calculate count(*)-count(@column), but in some databases
		that can double the execution time. 	
		
		Do not confuse this pattern with aggregation nor num_children. Aggregation is only for numerical attributes. 
		And num_children works on table level.
