	<description>Ratio of the two fields X and Y.
	
	Ratio(NULL, Y) = NULL
	Ratio(X, NULL) = NULL
	Ratio(X, 0) = NULL
	Ratio(0, Y) = 0
	Ratio(X, Y) = 100*X/Y
	
	Note: The implementation prefers to return NULL when the ratio is ill defined.
	If you want to 0 instead of NULL, just add coalesce.
	
	NOTE: COULD HAVE BEEN EXTENDED INTO RATIOS OF AGGREGATES
