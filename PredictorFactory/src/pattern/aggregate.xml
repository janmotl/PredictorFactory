	<description>
		Apply aggregation function on numerical attributes. Following aggregate functions were selected for being 
		supported in many databases: avg, min, max and stddev_samp.
		
		Note that "stddev_samp" is automatically translate to the database specific command for sample standard
		deviation (for example, MS SQL is using "stddev" while Oracle is using "stddev_samp"). Hence if you want
		sample standard deviation, use "stddev_samp" keyword, even if you are using MS SQL, to make the script 
		transferable.
		
		Note that "count" attribute is not in the set as it is enough to calculate the count only once per table 
		(see num_children). But aggregate functions are calculated per each numerical column. 
		
		The ratio of missing values is calculated in a separate pattern (null_ratio) as it can be calculated on 
		any data column, not only on numerical columns.
		
		Distinct values are aggregate in a different pattern (aggregate_distinct) because min(distinct X) == min(X)
		but count(distinct X) != count(X).
		
		Time values are aggregated in an a separate pattern (time_since) since it requires casting of time attribute
		into number. 
		
		NOTE: ADDED SUM
